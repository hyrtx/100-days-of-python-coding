# Day 11: Number Guessing Game

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a Number Guessing Game. The computer will select a number between 1 and 100. It is your job to guess that number. You'll have a number of attempts according to the choosen difficulty. If you choose easy, you'll have 10 attemps. Meanwhile, if you choose hard, you'll have only 5 attempts.

The idea behind this project is to take what we've learned in the previous days and apply it to functions.

## How to Use
Execute the `main.py` script to start the game.

```sh
# Command to run the script
python main.py
```
