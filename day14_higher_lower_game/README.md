# Day 14: Higher Lower Game

## Description
The goal of this project is to create the game Higher Lower.

In this game, you have to select the option that you think it has more followers on Instagram. The game counts your score until you lose.

The idea behind this project is to take what we've learned in the previous days and apply it to functions.

## How to Use
Execute the `main.py` script to start the game.

```sh
# Command to run the script
