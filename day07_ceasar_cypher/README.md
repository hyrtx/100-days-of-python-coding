# Day 07: Ceasar Cypher

## Description
The goal of this project is to create the **Ceasar Cypher**. The Ceasar Cypher is a simple encryption technique in which each letter in a text is replaced by another letter shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

For example, in a text with a shift of 3, the letter 'A' would be shifted by 'D'.

The idea behind this challenge is to work with functions.

## How to Use
Execute the `main.py` script to start the game.

```sh
# Command to run the script
python main.py
```
For the first test of the cypher, i suggest the following steps:

1. Select the `encode` option and write the word `grape`, and choose a shift number of 5;
2. When the restart option shows, select `yes`;
3. Now, select the option `decode` and write the encoded grape word, with the same shift number of 5. You'll receive the word `grape`. Nice, huh?

Now you can test with your own words. Have fun.
